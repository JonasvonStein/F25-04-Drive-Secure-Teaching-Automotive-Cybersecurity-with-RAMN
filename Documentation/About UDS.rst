According to Google:

Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) is a communication protocol that is primarily used in the automotive industry for diagnostics and testing. It runs on top of CAN FD and provides a common set of diagnostic functions like ECU programming and data monitoring. UDS enables ECUs to interact constantly across different vehicle manufacturers and systems. 

UDS exploitation:

UDS exploitation refers to cyberattacks that target the diagnostic services in a vehicle. Attackers with access to the CAN FD bus can use UDS commands to read data or overwrite ECU memory. The RAMN device is used to simulate and practice UDS attacks. 

Types of Attacks: 

Memory Reprogramming Attacks: An attacker could overwrite ECU software to change the system’s behavior

Data Leakage: Attackers can access vehicle sensor data through UDS

Service Identifier Exploitation: Attackers can use UDS Service Identifiers to provide false information about a vehicle
