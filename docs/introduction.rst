Purpose and Who We Are
----------------------

Our customer, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, wants to utilize the Resistant Automotive Miniature Network (RAMN) to help develop
cybersecurity practices and facilitate a learning environment for future cybersecurity and automotive engineering students.
The RAMN serves as an educational tool to highlight the vulnerabilities of automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs).
This website provides a background on the RAMN board, an extensive overview of how to set up the required environment to interact with the board, and several cybersecurity challenges.  

What is RAMN?
-------------

RAMN (Resistant Automotive Miniature Network) is a credit-card-sized ECU testbed for safely studying and researching automotive systems.
Check out the official `What is RAMN? <https://ramn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html>`_ page for more info.


What is on this website?
------------------------

This website will show you what on the `RAMN Read The Docs <https://ramn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
is important for the cybersecurity challenges we made and provide extra details on things like how to use the RAMN.
