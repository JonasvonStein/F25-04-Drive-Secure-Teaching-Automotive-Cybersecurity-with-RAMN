*** ORGANIZER INSTRUCTIONS *** 

- FLAGS AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE FILE.
- Flags are in plaintext in firmware files - those should not be provided to participants.
- ECUs TEMPORARY memory protection should be activated to prevent flag dumping (be sure not to use PERMANENT protection or it will lock your board).


*** PARTICIPANT INSTRUCTIONS *** 

Flag format is flag{xxx}. Letter in brackets ([X]) indicates in which ECU the flag is stored.

There are four ECUs and each ECU uses a different diagnostic interface (Custom, KWP2000, UDS, and XCP).

Firmware is different from the GitHub version so RAMN scripts won't work as is (many features are disabled), but the source code (notably [diagnostic scripts](https://github.com/ToyotaInfoTech/RAMN/tree/main/scripts/diagnostics) and the [documentation](https://ramn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/diag_tutorial.html) can be used as a reference on how to use diagnostic services .

Flash address range is 0x08000000 to 0x08040000, RAM is 0x20000000 to 0x20040000. With Ghidra, use ARM:LE:32:v8:default and entry point 0x08000000.

All challenges are independent and four people can work independently on each ECU. Note that ECU A requires other ECUs to be active to read inputs.
A maximum-size ISO-TP packet transfer typically takes 7 seconds, and a 256kB XCP dump typically takes 75 seconds. If you want to speed up your scripts, you may want to [disable ECUs you don't need](https://ramn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/usb_tutorial.html#enable-power-supply-y).
If there are more teams than devices available, you will probably need two sessions: one to gather intelligence on diagnostic services (e.g. memory dumps), and another one to try your attacks.

You can use the USB port as an [slcan USB to CAN adapter](https://ramn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/can_tutorial.html#interfacing-with-linux). Feel free to ask for assistance.
Depending on your environment, you may experience slcan-related issues beyond our control (including dropped frames). 
You can mitigate these issues by setting the ST or BS parameters of ISO-TP to values different than 0, but overall we recommend that you use an external CAN adapter.
If you want to use the tool "caringcaribou", be aware that it has several critical bugs, so please contact us first for a patch.

Note that ECU Aâ€™s screen can only show received CAN messages, not transmitted. The Bootloader mode of ECUs is not part of intended solves and should be of no help.


*** CHALLENGES *** 

Title: [A] Secret Menu

Challenge Description: Look away while I input my password! 
(Note: flag has been redacted in the attached file; you must recover the actual flag from a device).
(Note: there are USB commands to enter bootloader mode to reprogram ECUs, but these are for organizers use only. They will automatically erase the flags so do not use them.)
Attachment: ECUA/ECUA_REDACTED.elf
Intended difficulty: Medium
----

Title: [B] Sit Next To Me

Challenge Description: You wouldn't download a byte. 

(Note: Flag will be transmitted once on ID 0x777 when challenge is solved.)

Intended difficulty: Easy/Medium
----

Title: [C] Come again?

Challenge Description: The 2000s called; they want their ECU back.

Intended difficulty: Medium
----

Title: [D] Light the way

Challenge Description: These LEDs were made for lighting.

(Hint: dumpable firmware size is 0x0c548 bytes, don't spend your time looking for more.)

Intended difficulty: Medium
----
