Screens (Gateway/Infotainment)
==============================

The SCREENS expansion is used to add a screen to an ECU. Although it can be used on any ECU, it is by default the expansion we use for ECU A (Gateway ECU).

This expansion features various `pin sockets <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_header>`_ to connect screens from `Adafruit <https://www.adafruit.com/>`_.
Our preferred choice is the 240x240 TFT color Screen `Adafruit 4313 <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4313>`_, since it has a good balance between size, readability, and cost.

We selected those screens mainly because they can be powered by 5V but controlled by 3.3V logic, without external components.

.. warning:: We only tested screens for the J5 pin sockets. Other screens are not guaranteed to work.
