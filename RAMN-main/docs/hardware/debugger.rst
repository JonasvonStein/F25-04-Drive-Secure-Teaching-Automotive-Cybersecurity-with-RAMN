Debugger
========

The DEBUGGER expansion is used to easily probe every output of the expansion pin socket, as well as to easily connect a JTAG debugger to the ECU.

JTAG Debugger
-------------

A `standard 20-pin JTAG connector <https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/assmann-wsw-components/AWHW-20A-0202-T/5050385>`_ is present on the debugger expansion. This allows the user to connect a debugger such as the `ST-LINK V2 <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html>`_ to easily develop and debug new firmware for the ECU.
